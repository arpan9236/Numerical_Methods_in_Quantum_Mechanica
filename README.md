Here, I have written python codes for numerical methods in Quantum Mechanics which is taught by Paolo Giannozzi (Developer of Quantum ESPRESSO code and Professor at University of Udine, Italy) and noted in a book/pdf given in his website. My vision is to understand the numerical methods, apply in quantum mechanical and solid state physics problems and write all the codes in python. I have started working on it and some problems with Schrodinger equaion in 1D are uploaded till now. Many more to come. Finally, I will apply all the methods and write the codes of density functional theory (DFT) using python.
